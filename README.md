# Scavenging Expansion

A mod for the management video-game Rimworld aiming to provide new options for scavenger playstyles.

## Features

### Short-term

- New weapons and armors made with metallic scrap from fallen mechanoids
- Refining of mechanoids scraps into alloys, allowing for the fabrication of better gear.
- Disassemble some of the toughest mechanoids to have a chance to salvage rare and unique parts which may be used in the construction of powerful weapons, armors or buildings
- A brand new way of acquiring technology through salvaged blueprints and survey data
- New scavenging themed events to spice up gameplay.


## Compatibilty

This mod requires to be loaded after **Harmony**.

It is highly recommended that you use both **High Quality Textures** (or **Graphic Settings +**) and **Vanilla Framework Expended** with the *Disable Texture Caching* option turned **on**, otherwise textures will appear extremely blurry due to how the game compresses textures.

Currently **not** compatible with **Combat Extended**. Compatibility with CE was originally planned but was dropped since maintaining two different sets of values for all weapons/armor proved to be too much work. However we left in the files so if you want to use them to help you make your own patch you can do so.

Probably incompatible with Mutliplayer, since advanced salvaging uses RNG it is likely to cause desyncs.

This mod has integrations with **Vanilla Factions Expanded - Mechanoids**, **Vanilla Factions Expanded - Vikings**, **Alpha Animals**, **Orion's More Mechanoids**, **Mechanoid Recon Hive**, **Mechanoids Extraordinaire** and **Rimsenal Federation** with new unique gear with better stats craftable from special materials extracted from the corpses of these mods toughest enemies.

Otherwise this should not have any hard incompatibilty with any other mods (should you find one please report it to us however), the worst that could happen would be mechanoids from unpatched mods not yielding any scrap when disassembled. We can't guarantee we will be able to support every single mechanoid mod, but if you happen to find a mechanoid mod which doesn't have scrap drops, please notify us and we'll try to write a patch.
