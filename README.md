# Scavenging Expansion

A mod for the management video-game Rimworld aiming to provide new options for scavenger playstyles.

## Features

### Short-term

- New weapons and armors made with metallic scrap from fallen mechanoids

### Long-term

- A new hostile faction made of scavengers, helped by their animals clad in their scrap armors such as the deadly Armored Megaspider
- Refining of mechanoids scraps into alloys, allowing for the fabrication of better gear.
- New scavenging themed events to spice up gameplay.
- A new Scavenger Ideology meme, allowing you to craft said gear at a new crafting table, but restricting research speed to either "None" or "Very Low".

## Compatibilty

This mod requires to be loaded after **Harmony**.

It is highly recommended that you use both **High Quality Textures** (or **Graphic Settings +**) and **Vanilla Framework Expended** with the *Disable Texture Caching* option turned **on**, otherwise textures will appear extremely blurry.

Compatible with Combat Extended, but balance might be inconsistent. Any suggestions on how to improve CE balance are welcome.

Integration with Vanilla Factions Expanded - Mechanoids is also planned, with new unique gear with better stats craftable from special materials extracted from the corpses of this mod toughest enemies.

Otherwise this should be compatible out of the box with most other mods, we will however look into how our mod interacts with other mechanoid altering mods (though we cannot guarantee we will be able to provide support for all of them).
