# Scavenging Expansion

A mod for the management video-game Rimworld aiming to provide new options for scavenger playstyles.

## Features

### Short-term

- New weapons and armors made with metallic scrap from fallen mechanoids

### Long-term

- A new hostile faction made of scavengers, helped by their animals clad in their scrap armors such as the deadly Armored Megaspider
- Refining of mechanoids scraps into alloys, allowing for the fabrication of better gear.
- New scavenging themed events to spice up gameplay.
- A new Scavenger Ideology meme, allowing you to craft said gear at a new crafting table, but restricting research speed to either "None" or "Very Low".

## Compatibilty

This mod requires to be loaded after **Harmony**.

It is highly recommended that you use both **High Quality Textures** (or **Graphic Settings +**) and **Vanilla Framework Expended** with the *Disable Texture Caching* option turned **on**, otherwise textures will appear extremely blurry due to how the game compresses textures.

Compatible with Combat Extended, but balance might be inconsistent. Any suggestions on how to improve CE balance are welcome.

Probably incompatible with Mutliplayer, since advanced salvaging uses RNG it is likely to cause desyncs.

Integration with Vanilla Factions Expanded - Mechanoids, Alpha Animals and Orion's More Mechanoids is also planned, with new unique gear with better stats craftable from special materials extracted from the corpses of these mods toughest enemies.

Otherwise this should not have any hard incompatibilty with any other mods (should you find one please report it to us however), the worst that could happen would be mechanoids from unpatched mods not yielding any scrap when disassembled. We can't guarantee we will be able to support every single mechanoid mod, but if you happen to find a mechanoid mod which doesn't have scrap drops, please notify us and we'll try to write a patch.
