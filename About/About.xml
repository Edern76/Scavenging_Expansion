    <description>A mod aiming to provide new options for scavenger playstyles.

    At first it will contain various weapons and armors made of mechanoid remains, but it will be expanded in the future with a new faction, new animals and a new Ideology meme. 
    
    Art and concept by Sir Van, code by Edern.
